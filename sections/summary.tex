\noindent
The focus of my internship is on Full-Stack Software Development to build interactive Web Dashboards.
The purpose of these Dashboard's are to serve as administrative systems that administrators can use to interact
with the Database and perform complex operations with ease.
This involves me following the Requirements/Specifications for the projects and implementing it using relevant Software Design Patterns.
I am also gaining a deeper undertanding of Software Architectures of Web Applications, by working on all layers of the application from
Database modelling using Google Firebase, backend using Node.JS and the User interface using VueJS.
