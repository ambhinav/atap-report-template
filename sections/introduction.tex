\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Background and Organizational Structure of Host Organization}
\noindent
I am doing my ATAP at Intra Technologies Private Limited, a software development house start-up that has a few self-initiated projects.
The CEO, COO and CTO work together to manage the timelines, business development of these projects.
The projects the company has initiated include Lemon and Rest. I am currently focused on developing software for Lemon, with the CTO as my supervisor. 

\subsection{Principal Activities of Host Organization}
\noindent
Intra Technologies is a start up that has projects that capitalize on opportunities in various markets.

\subparagraph{Lemon}
serves to offer additional services to customers who hail ride sharing services such as Grab or Gojek. In their
pilot trial, customers can buy various items from within the vehicle. Lemon is the main focus of the company now.

\subparagraph{Rest}
is a service that allows customers to book Hotel Rooms in advance or with short notice from its platform to 
maximize convenience. Additionally customers can pay by the hour for said rooms, and can choose from 
many established Hotel partners that Rest has.

\subsection{Training Programme within Host Organization}
\noindent
As the company is a start-up, the structure of the organization is not fixed and we are asked to be open to changes in said structure. 
Nevertheless, I am considered to be part of the software development team supervised by the CTO.
Intra Technologies has provided various Udemy courses\cite{REF1:1} on Software Development for interns to learn using.
These courses aim to help us familiarize with
the tools that will be used to build the platforms for Lemon and Rest.
