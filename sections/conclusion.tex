\section{Conclusion}
\subsection{Summary Of Work Completed And Training Received}
\noindent
The training I received was learning about the project's background and the skills in NLP.

\noindent
One of the major work I completed is setting up the NLP pipeline that can easily integrate into the backend code.

\noindent
The second major work I completed is the setting up the backend endpoints to fetch data from database.

\noindent
Other works I have done include topic modeling, web scraping, user testing with mockups, queue system for pipeline, sharing NLP results, redesigning chatbot interface, automating regression testing, and training chatbot with DialogFlow.
 
\subsection{Problems Faced}
\noindent
One problem I am investigating is how I can optimize the NLP pipeline to handle large datasets more efficiently as the current computation time and memory usage is unfeasible for long term usage.

\noindent
The second problem I am exploring is to optimize the platform for production-ready software. I plan to integrate Kurbenetes and GraphQL into the platform in future.

\subsection{Assessment Of Training Experience And Concluding Remarks}
\noindent
I enjoyed learning about NLP. In fact, I am learning how to use NLP for foreign languages, since I am also learning a foreign language currently. I hope to have opportunities to learn Natural Language Understanding (NLU) in chatbot if the project caters for it. Besides my current team, I would be joining another team to work on Robotics and Artificial Intelligence. I cannot wait to learn more about Machine Learning and Deep Learning in the other team.
