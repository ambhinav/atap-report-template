\section{Conclusion}
\subsection{Summary Of Work Completed And Training Received}
\noindent
The bulk of the training I received was in understanding the requirements of the project and coding skills in VueJS. This helped
me design and build the Web components more efficiently.
\noindent
My first major contribution was building the IMS system, which integrated with the Database.
\noindent
My second contribution was that of optimising the payment flow in the backend. This involved updating a few of the endpoints to add side effects based on the requirements.
\noindent
Other notable contributions include developer testing of the entire system and helping with Database modelling.
 
\subsection{Problems Faced}
\noindent
A problem I am facing is writing and automating tests for the Web Application. The project is complex as it uses many frameworks, SDK, libraries
and such tools whose ecosystems are evolving constantly. As such, it is difficult to automate integration tests for important components such as
payment. I am currently looking to add CI/CD tools to update the dependencies regularly, as well as find testing suites that
are suitable for our technological stack.

\noindent
The second problem I faced was helping with Database Modelling. As the project deals with significantly more data than
I am used to, I found it difficult to provide solutions to design considerations for working with the Database model used. I had to 
research and implement strategies such as Database Normalisation in a relatively short period of time.

\subsection{Assessment Of Training Experience And Concluding Remarks}
\noindent
I find the Software Development Process to be enriching and challenging at times. Although Firebase's BaaS model is optimal for 
the requirements of the company's projects, I believe I am unable to learn about Full-Stack Architecture in greater detail as BaaS is constrictive and less robust.
Nevertheless, I am looking forward to improving the Lemon's system using CI/CD, testing and possibly Dockerization in the coming months.
